// A member opened for the second time paints from its cached copy first, and
// that copy is older than everything the account holds about the message.
//
// The copy on disk is written by a live read, as the server answered it. The
// first opening of an unread member is exactly that read, so the file says
// unread — and the quiet mark-read that follows changes the store the rail
// draws from, never the file. Opening the member again hands the reader the
// file before the network answers, and what it says must not overwrite what
// the account already knows: the stop the rail draws for it would go unread
// for one round trip, and the reader would mark it read a second time.
//
// The account is a real `MailAccount` with `reader.open` scripted the way the
// backend answers it — the cached copy at once, the live one when the test
// says so — and `act` recorded rather than sent, with the optimistic view it
// leaves behind applied by hand.
